Its sleek body, long tail and pointed wings gives it an appearance not unlike Kestrels or Sparrowhawks. Cuckoos are summer visitors and known for being brood parasites. This means that, instead of building their own nest, the females lay their eggs in other birds’ nests, especially Meadow Pipits, Dunnocks and Reed Warblers. When a female Cuckoo finds a suitable nest, and the hosts aren’t looking, she removes one of their eggs and lays her own egg in its place. Cuckoo young hatch after just 12 days, and push the hosts’ eggs or babies out of the nest, allowing it to eat all food brought by the host bird. By the time the Cuckoo leaves the nest, it is far bigger than the host bird, but the adoptive parent continues to feed the young Cuckoo for a further two weeks. With their young being raised by another bird, adult Cuckoos are free to leave the UK much earlier. Most leave during June for Africa, where they spend winter. The young Cuckoos leave later on, once they’re fully fledged. Their recent population decline makes this a Red List species in the 2021 UK Conservation Status Report. Red is the highest conservation priority, with species on this list needing urgent action. Species on this list, such as Cuckoos, are globally threatened, with big declines in breeding populations and ranges.', 'canto_url': '/audio/Cuckoo.mp3'

Look for its downcurved bill, brown upperparts, long legs and listen for its evocative, bubbling, call. In the winter, you’ll see Curlews feeding in groups on tidal mudflats, saltmarshes and nearby farmland. While some of our birds spend the winter in Ireland and France, we get an influx of Scandinavianbreeding Curlews here, who make the most of our relatively mild winters. In the spring and summer, Curlews migrate to their breeding grounds in upland areas of rough pasture, heather moorland and wetland. Curlews breed on a range of habitats, but like rough grasslands, moorlands and bogs best of all. Intensive farming practices, including drainage and reseeding, are likely to have contributed to declines in breeding populations, as has the turning of areas of moorlands into forest. Together, these activities are having a huge impact on Curlew populations. Curlew numbers are also impacted by nest predators, mainly foxes, who take eggs, chicks and adult birds. Like many wading birds, Curlews lay their eggs in a nest on the ground known as a ‘scrape’. The parents incubate the eggs for about four weeks, before the young leave the nest and roam around with their parents for a further four weeks until fledging. The UK breeding population of Curlews is of international importance, with around 30% of the west European population spending winter in the UK. Despite this, there have been worrying declines in the breeding population in much of the UK. In 2015, Curlews were added to the Red List on the UK Conservation Status Report. Red is the highest conservation priority, with species on this list needing urgent action. Curlews are struggling, with big declines in breeding populations and ranges.
